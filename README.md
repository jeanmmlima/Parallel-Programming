# Parallel-Programming

This folder keeps basic parallel programming projects.

# Parallel Jacobi's Method (C and C++)

The codes above implement the Jacobi's Method to solve Linear Systems Parallelized using OMP and PThreads API. It is also included the serial code.

# EstimatePi
This directory keeps 4 code files to estimate Pi's value using the Monte Carlo method. The first of them, it is the serial way. The others three estimate Pi's value by using the API MPI (Message-Passing Interface) allowing a parallel processment of the code.
